In React, `useState` is a Hook that allows you to add state management to functional components. State is used to store and 
manage data that can change over time, like user inputs, form fields, or UI toggles. `useState` provides you with a 
pair: the current state value and a function to update that state.

Here's how `useState` works:
- **Initialization**: It takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array containing two values: the current state 
    and a function to update it.
- **Reactivity**: When the state is updated using the provided function, the component re-renders to reflect the new state.


```
### Explanation
- **Initial State**: `useState(0)` initializes the `count` state with `0`.
- **State Update**: When the "Increment" button is clicked, the `increment` 
    function is called, updating the state using `setCount(count + 1)`.
- **Re-rendering**: The component re-renders, displaying the updated count.
