What is Lazy Loading in React?
Lazy loading means loading components only when they are needed â€” not when the application initially loads.

It's a performance optimization.

Instead of bundling everything upfront (which increases page load time), React lets you split your code and load 
components dynamically when the user navigates to them.

React provides:

React.lazy() to define a lazily loaded component.

Suspense to show a fallback (like a spinner) while the component is loading.
